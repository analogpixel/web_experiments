Meetup.com makes it a pain to unsubscribe from groups. You have to click on each group, wait for the page to load, then click on the unsubscribe link, wait for the page to load, then click the unsubscribe link. Doesn't sound too horrible but when you have a bunch of groups it's pretty tedious. I can only assume that Meetup doesn't provid the functionality to do this because you being a member of a lot of groups is good for their metrics.

So to get around this, I created a grease monkey script that will quickly remove you from all the groups you select:

Just load this script into greasemonkey, and go to https://www.meetup.com/groups/. Give the page 2 seconds to load, and then scroll ALL the way to the bottom of the page and you should see a list of groups you can unsubscribe from.
